# Anomaly detection in quasi-periodic energy consumption data series: a comparison of algorithms

The diffusion of domotics solutions and of smart appliances and meters enables the monitoring of energy consumption at a very fine level and the development of forecasting and diagnostic applications.  Anomaly detection (AD) in energy consumption data streams helps identify data points or intervals in which the behavior of an appliance deviates from normality, which may prevent energy losses and break downs. Many statistical and learning approaches have been applied to the task, but  the need remains of comparing their performances with data sets of different characteristics. This paper focuses on anomaly detection on quasi-periodic energy consumption data series and contrasts 10 statistical and machine learning algorithms on a data set containing the power consumption signals of fridges. The assessment also evaluates the impact of the length of the series used for training and of the size of the sliding window employed to detect the anomalies.
